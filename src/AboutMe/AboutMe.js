          <p>
            As a Google Ads specialist, I help{' '}
            <strong>ambitious companies</strong> get the most out of Google Ads.
            I work for a select number of clients and am responsible for over
            â‚¬1,500,000 per month in ad spend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on more than 100
            Google Ads accounts. Often challenging accounts from great names,
            including&nbsp;
            <strong>
              Weight Watchers, Louwman, Harley Davidson, KPMG, Schoonenberg,{' '}

            I also provide <strong>Google Ads courses</strong> and 1-on-1&nbsp;
            <strong>coaching sessions</strong>. In these, I share my knowledge
            with <strong>novice to very advanced</strong> Google Ads
